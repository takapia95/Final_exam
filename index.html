      <p> Please create a new repl for the final exam. Copy all the files you created for the midterm into this repl.
        Check your midterm feedback and make adjustments as directed. If you didn't get 100% on the
        midterm you MUST make the corrections listed in the feedback.<br>
        Modify the pages: do a Search for “Midterm”. Replace with “Final Exam”.<br>
        Replace the midterm instructions text on the home page with this scenario text:
        The customer wants you to modify the existing website you created for the midterm. They want to add
        a new page that functions as a simple tip calculator. Simple here means no tips split among several
        people. The new page needs to be accessible from the existing site nav on every page in the site.<br>
        The page should use the existing site layout. Provide a page title and a “caption” reflecting “Tip
        Calculator”.<br>
        Directly entry user input should be restricted to one filed: let the user enter a food total.<br>
        Let the user choose tip amounts using a slider control. You can set this control to go from 10 % to 50%
        for example, and the user can choose any amount between these numbers, even unusual tip
        percentages like 17%. The percentage should also display on the page.<br>
        [Note: If you cannot get the slider to work, you can use a dropdown for fewer points. In that case, offer
        the use tip percentages in 5 % increments, for example 10%, 15%, etc. ]<br>
        After the user chooses a tip % amount, calculate that tip using the food total entered earlier. Display
        the tip amount and the total amount. Hint: use a “Calculate” button and a “click” event.<br>
        Example: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ev_onclick.asp
        <br> Let the user clear the food total field and the tip amount field as well as the display values. Note that
        if
        you use a reset button, it will only clear the input fields and the tip percent display value. How can you
        clear inputs and all display values with one button?
        <br>Test the functionality of your site, including the new nav.
        <br>Please submit your shareable repl.it link.
